The "filedirectory.xlsx" holds the location for the excel file used to store customer purchases.
"new1" is the excel file used to store customer purchases.
If you want to put "new1" into a different directory, change the file location in the first row and first column inside of filedirectory, first sheet (sheet 1)

This program eliminates human error/calculation mistakes when making receipts and also eliminates the process of encoding.
This is by far, the biggest project I have made as I honestly have no clue on what I could make next.
